# Jan 1st Weekday Finder ðŸ“…

A C program that determines the **day of the week** for January 1st of any given year. This project reinforces logical reasoning and modular arithmetic using leap year calculations.

## ðŸ§® How It Works

- Accepts a year as input.
- Computes the number of **leap years** and **normal years** up to that year.
- Uses a mathematical formula to calculate the day offset from a base reference.
- Maps the remainder (`n % 7`) to the corresponding weekday.
