# Currency Distribution 💰

A C program that calculates the **minimum number of notes and coins** required to make up a given amount of money (up to ₹10,000). This is part of my foundational C programming exercises.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Takes a single input: the total amount of money.
- Breaks down the amount using denominations: ₹1000, ₹500, ₹100, ₹10, ₹5, and ₹1.
- Outputs the number of each denomination required using basic arithmetic operations.
