# BMI Calculator 🧮

A C program that calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on a user's weight and height, and categorizes their BMI status. This is part of my foundational C programming series.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Accepts input for:
  - Weight in **kilograms**
  - Height in **feet** (converted internally to meters)
- Computes BMI using the formula:
  BMI=WEIGHT/(HEIGHT(in metre))^2
