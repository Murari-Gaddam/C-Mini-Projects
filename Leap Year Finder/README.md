# Leap Year Finder (Ternary Operator Edition) 🗓️

A compact C program that checks whether a given year is a **leap year** using the conditional (ternary) operator. Part of my foundational projects in C to experiment with concise syntax and logic.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Accepts a year as input from the user.
- Uses the standard rule:
  - Divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100  
  **or** divisible by 400 → **Leap Year**

- Implements this logic in one line using the ternary operator
